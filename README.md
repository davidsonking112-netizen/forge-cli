# Forge CLI

Forge is a lightweight, local-first terminal AI coding agent built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**.

The TypeScript/Node.js supervisor owns the command-line interface, terminal events, workspace policy, approvals, tool execution, and session persistence. The Python worker owns the agent loop, context assembly, and provider boundary. The runtimes communicate through a versioned JSONL protocol over standard input and output.

## Status

Forge is an early v0.1 development release. The current implementation includes a deterministic mock provider so the end-to-end agent workflow can be tested without API credentials. A real provider adapter will be added after the safety and protocol surfaces are established.

## Development requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- Python 3.11 or newer
- npm

## Development setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ./python
```

Run diagnostics:

```bash
node dist/apps/forge-cli/src/main.js doctor
```

Run the deterministic plan flow:

```bash
node dist/apps/forge-cli/src/main.js plan "Explain this repository"
```

Start an interactive session:

```bash
node apps/forge-cli/dist/main.js
```

## Safety model

Forge starts in read-only exploration mode. File writes and command execution are gated, bounded, and visible. Repository instruction files are treated as untrusted guidance and cannot override the local policy. Forge does not persist provider credentials, does not expose common secret files by default, and does not include unrestricted auto-approval in v0.1.
